* General tasks
** TODO the great lock overhaul
   - reorganize locking structures to be consistent, so we can keep track of
     them in one place
** TODO taskify logging
   - write a new logger that runs in a separate task, so logging can happen away
     from the execution of the threads themselves
** TODO PCIe support
** TODO EHCI/XHCI support
** TODO USB support
